# Strategic-Customer-Segmentation-in-E-Commerce-Using-Hierarchical-Clustering-and-K-Means
**GOAL:** analyze e-commerce data and applyclustering techniques to segment customers, identifying the ideal target audience to maximize the impact of business strategies.

# Intro
We will use the online retail transactional dataset from Kaggle to build RFM clusters with the goal of identifying the most strategic customer segments for the company to target. RFM analysis ia an effective segmentation methodology that cassifies customers based on three key criteria:

**- Recency (time since the last purchase)**

**- Frequency (number of transactions made)**

**- Monetary Value (total amount spent by customers)**

# Methods
**PCA:** statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction and data exploration.

**Hierarchical CLustering:** used to visualize the structure of the data and get an idea of the optimal number of clusters.

**K-Means:** Clustering algorithm that devides data into k groups based on similarities, optimizing the distance of points to the center og each cluster.

# Analysis
Hierarchical clustering provides a more exploratory view, showing the hierarchical relationships between the data, while K-Means is more afficient and straightfoward in assigning groups.

# Conclusion
The results indicates that customers segmentation was successful, with each class representating a unique profile.

**- Cluster 0:** focus on retaining high-value customers

**- Cluster 1:** identify reasons for inactivity to attempt reactivation

**- Cluster 2:** Loyal and high-value customers

**- Cluster 3:** incentive campaign to increase engagement


The combination of both tecniques provides greater reliability and understanding of the data patterns.
